# Beacon Demos

These are a few small demo projects showing how to use beacons in Xamarin.iOS and Xamarin.Android apps.

- `BeaconBroadcaster`: iOS app that broadcasts as an iBeacon
- `IosReceiver`: iOS app that ranges for the beacon in `BeaconBroadcaster` and shows proximity to it
- `DroidReceiver`: Android app that ranges for the beacon in `BeaconBroadcaster` and shows proximity to it

This demo was part of this talk: [Building Context-Aware Apps with Beacons](https://speakerdeck.com/gshackles/building-context-aware-apps-with-beacons)
